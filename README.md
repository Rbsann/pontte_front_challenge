This project was created using yarn create react-app.I am using React version 16.3 (current latest version)

For the single request the app demanded i used axios library, for no particular reason.

I opted to use React Hooks and context instead of Redux. It is lighter , less verbose and easier to work with. 

Apparently it seems Redux is being used only in large multi state projects.
